# 🚀 DSA for Developers – Master Core Concepts with C++

Welcome to **DSA for Developers** – a beginner-friendly repository tailored for **web and app developers** who want to build a solid understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

This repo is **not for competitive programming**.  
It’s for developers like you and me — who care about writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?

As developers, we spend most of our time **building applications**, but understanding DSA is crucial to:

- Write **optimized code**
- Improve **logic-building** skills
- Perform better in **interviews**

So, I created this repo to:
- 🧠 Focus on **concept clarity** over complexity
- ✅ Provide **simple and clean C++ implementations**
- 💡 Share insights that matter to **developers**
