ðŸ“Œ Binary Number System
Binary uses only 0 and 1.

Used in all digital systems, especially computers.

Conversion is essential in understanding how data is stored or computed.

Binary to Decimal Conversion Logic:

Multiply each digit by powers of 2 starting from right to left.

Add all these values.

Decimal to Binary Conversion Logic:

Divide the number by 2 repeatedly.

Record remainders.

Reverse the remainders to get binary.

ðŸ”§ Data Type Modifiers in C++
Used to change the size or behavior of built-in data types:

short: Decreases the size (usually 2 bytes).

long: Increases size (4 or 8 bytes).

long long: Even bigger than long.

signed: Can store both positive and negative values.

unsigned: Only positive values (doubles the positive range).

You can combine them: e.g., unsigned long.
