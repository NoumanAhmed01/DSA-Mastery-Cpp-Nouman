ðŸ”¹ Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class. It allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchy between classes.

Base Class (Parent Class): The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.

Derived Class (Child Class): The class that inherits properties from another class.

ðŸ”¸ Types of Inheritance:
Single Inheritance:

In this type, one class inherits from a single base class.

Multiple Inheritance:

In this type, a class inherits from more than one base class.

Multilevel Inheritance:

A type of inheritance where a class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class (forming a chain).

Hierarchical Inheritance:

A type of inheritance where one base class is inherited by multiple derived classes.

Hybrid Inheritance:

A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., multiple and multilevel inheritance).
