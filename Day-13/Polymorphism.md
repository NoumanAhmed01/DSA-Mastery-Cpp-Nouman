🔹 What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means “many forms”.
In C++, polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

🔸 Types of Polymorphism:
Compile-Time Polymorphism

Run-Time Polymorphism

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism:
   Occurs during compilation.

✅ Function Overloading
Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

✅ Operator Overloading
Using operators (+, -, etc.) with user-defined data types.

2. Run-Time Polymorphism:
   Occurs during program execution.

✅ Function Overriding
A derived class has a function with the same name and parameters as in the base class.
Requires inheritance and usually virtual functions.
