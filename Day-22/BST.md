ðŸ”¹ What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree with a special property:

Left subtree contains nodes less than the root.

Right subtree contains nodes greater than the root.

No duplicate nodes are allowed.

ðŸ”¹ Key Properties
Inorder traversal of a BST gives sorted elements.

Time complexity:

Best/Average: O(log N) (for balanced trees)

Worst: O(N) (for skewed trees)

ðŸ”¹ Key Operations
Insert a node

Delete a node

Search for a node

Inorder traversal

Root-to-leaf path printing
