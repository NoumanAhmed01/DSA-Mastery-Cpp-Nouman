🔹 What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that builds a solution incrementally and abandons a path (“backtracks”) as soon as it determines that the path cannot lead to a valid solution.

🔹 Key Concepts:
Recursive Exploration: Uses recursion to explore possible options.

Decision Tree: At each step, a decision is made to either include or exclude elements.

Backtrack Step: Undo the last choice and try another path if the current path fails.

🔹 Use Cases:
Generating subsets (Power Set)

Generating permutations

Solving Sudoku

N-Queens Problem

Maze solving
