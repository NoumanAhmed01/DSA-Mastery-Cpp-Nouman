Max Heap
â€ƒâ†’ The parent node is greater than or equal to its children.

Min Heap
â€ƒâ†’ The parent node is less than or equal to its children.

ðŸ”¹ Applications
Priority Queues

CPU Scheduling

Heap Sort

ðŸ”¹ Priority Queue
A Priority Queue uses a heap under the hood and automatically manages element order by priority:

Max Heap â†’ higher values come first

Min Heap â†’ lower values come first

ðŸ”¹ Common Operations
push() â†’ Insert element

pop() â†’ Remove top element

top() â†’ View top element

empty() â†’ Check if heap is empty
