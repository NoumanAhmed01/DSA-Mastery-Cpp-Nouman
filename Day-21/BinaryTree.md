Leaf: Node with no children

Edge: Link between parent and child

Parent/Child: Relationship between nodes

Sibling: Nodes with the same parent

Level: Depth of a node from the root (starting from 0)

Height: Longest path from root to a leaf

Subtree: Portion of a tree starting from a node

Degree: Number of children of a node

ðŸ”¹ Traversals
Inorder (LNR)

Preorder (NLR)

Postorder (LRN)

Level Order (BFS)

ðŸ”¹ Key Functions
